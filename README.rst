Official bot SDK of Token Ibis. For humans.

What is Token Ibis?
-------------------

Token Ibis is a grassroots organization committed to leveraging technology and armchair economics to make social impact a right for everyone.
In short, our mission is to raise philanthropic dollars, distribute it to a large population of individuals (currently University students), and empower them to donate to local nonprofits that speak to them.

Our flagship product is an open-source donation platform that enables users to do the following:

* Algorithmically receive a weekly *Universal Basic Philanthropy* (UBP) stipend
* Donate these *philanthropy dollars* to chosen nonprofits **or** send it to others to donate
* Browse nonprofit news and events as well as user-created posts
* Engage in basic social-media-like interations

You can find out more about our plans on our `website <https://tokenibis.org>`_ or peruse the codebase on `GitHub <https://github.com/Tokenibis/>`_.

What are ibots?
---------------

A key goal of Token Ibis is to keep an eye out for the *altruistic economy*, an armchair economic hope that users might eventually use philanthropy dollars as a greed-free form of currency for any number of economic interactions.

The ibots (ibis bots) program allows programmers to contribute to this economy by spinning up arbitrary services (bots) to interact with users.
For instance, ibots might play games, offer financial services, or reinforce pro-social behavior.
Unlike bots on other platforms, ibots are unique because they can throw real money around knowing that, no matter what happens, the money will go toward some charitable cause.
The magic of the altruistic economy of is that every transaction that happens in the meantime probably represents some positive and educational experience for the user.

The ibots SDK provides the following scaffolding to make bot development as painless as possible: 

* Scripts to easily spin up a local instance of the Token Ibis platform for testing
* Pythonic interface to access the Token Ibis API
* Concurrent framework to orchestrate multiple ibots from the same host
* Collection of common, useful :term:`resource`s to augment ibot functionality

Once finished, the ibot only needs login information and (in most cases) an initial balance of philanthropy dollars to deploy to the production network.

Useful ibots logic including anything from *for loops* and *if statements* to cutting-edge Machine Learning and NLP methods.
We hope that the ibots program can be a fun way for programming students to explore the highly approachable Python language in a way that contributes to real social impact immediately.
